# Keep the lights on

## About

That super simple bit of code can be built and uploaded to **Arduino** compatybile device.

It can be used to toggle state of relay based on reads from `HC-SR04` distance sensor. In a very small room that could translate to whether there is a person in the room or not.

It provides basic relay state change debounbcing to avoid flickering.

It filters out bad distance sensor reads based on configuration.
