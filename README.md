# Keep the lights on for me

That super simple bit of code can be built and uploaded to **Arduino** compatybile device.

It can be used to toggle state of relay based on read from `HC-SR04` distance sensor. In a very small room configuration that could translate to whether there is a person in the room or not.

It can be configured. It provides basic debounbcing to avoid flickering. It filters out bad reads based on configuration.
